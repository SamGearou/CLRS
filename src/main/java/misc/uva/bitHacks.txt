For the following examples, let S = 34 (100010)

To turn on the j-th bit:
S |= (1 << j)

To check is j-th bit is set (i.e., is a 1):
S &= (1 << j)

To clear/turn off the j-th bit:
S &= ~(1 << j)

To toggle (flip the status) of the j-th bit:
S ^= (1 << j)

To get the value of the least significant bit that is on (from the right):
T = S & (-S)

To turn on all bits in a set of size n:
S = (1 << n) -1
